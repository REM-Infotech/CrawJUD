            This PR contains **$COMMITS commits**, exceeding the limit of **$MAX_COMMITS commits**.

            ### How to fix:
            1. Use \`git rebase -i\` to combine (squash) related commits
            2. Keep only meaningful commits
            3. Ensure each commit represents a logical change

            Please reorganize the commits to continue with the review process."
