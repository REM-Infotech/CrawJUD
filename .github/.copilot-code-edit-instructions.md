Ensure that all Python code follows PEP 8 and PEP 257 standards. Automatically generate docstrings for all functions, methods, and classes using the Google docstring style. Also, include a module-level docstring at the beginning of each file.

If an existing docstring does not conform to the Google style, rewrite it to match the correct format.
