Use conventional commit message format.

If there were several changes of different types, separate them in the commit message detailing the changed file the type of change per line and Type of commit section (Chore, Feat, Refactor, etc).

In the central message, If the other commits have something like "[RHP-103]", include that too, or, if the branch has something like 'RHP-103' at the beginning of its name, include that in the commit message.
